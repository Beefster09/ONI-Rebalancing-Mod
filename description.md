This is an all-in-one mod that aims to rebalance the game.

This is a work in progress. View progress and balancing notes at https://github.com/Beefster09/ONI-Rebalancing-Mod

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome. Forking this mod is fine with me, just ask first and give credit when you do.

It [i]should[/i] be compatible with the base game, but I have only tested it with spaced out and can't guarantee it won't crash on startup.
